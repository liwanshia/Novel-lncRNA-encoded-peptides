# Novel-lncRNA-encoded-peptides
Large-scale ORF screening based on LC-MS to discover novel lncRNA-encoded peptides responding to ionizing radiation and microgravity
Abstract
In the human genome, 98% of genes can be transcribed into non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), among which lncRNAs and their encoded peptides play important roles in regulating various aspects of cellular processes and may serve as crucial factors in modulating the biological effects induced by ionizing radiation and microgravity. Unfortunately, there are few reports in space radiation biology on lncRNA-encoded peptides below 10kD due to limitations in detection techniques. To fill this gap, we integrated a variety of methods based on genomics and peptidomics, and discovered 22 lncRNA-encoded small peptides that are sensitive to space radiation and microgravity, which have never been reported before. We concurrently validated the transmembrane helix, subcellular localization, and biological function of these small peptides using bioinformatics and molecular biology techniques. More importantly, we found that these small peptides function independently of the lncRNAs that encode them. Our findings have uncovered a previously unknown human proteome encoded by 'non-coding' genes in response to space conditions and elucidated their involvement in biological processes, providing valuable strategies for individual protection mechanisms for astronauts who carry out deep space exploration missions in space radiation. environments.
Our workflow diagram is as follows:
